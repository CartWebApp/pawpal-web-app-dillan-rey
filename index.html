            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>At PawPal, we believe that every wag, purr, and chirp tells a story, and we're here to make sure that story is a long, healthy, and happy one! Born out of a shared love for animals and a desire to help pet parents stay connected to their furry (and feathered!) friends' well-being, PawPal began as a simple idea: What if caring for your pet could feel as natural as loving them?</p>

                <h2>Our Service</h2>
                <p>Our team of pet lovers, veterinarians, and tech enthusiasts came together to create a wellness tracker designed with heart. From daily walks and mealtimes to vet visits and medication reminders, PawPal helps you keep tabs on every part of your pet's health—all in one easy, tail-wagging app.</p>
                <p>We know that pets aren't just animals—they're family. That's why PawPal isn't just about tracking numbers; it's about nurturing relationships. We want to help you celebrate the little things—like that first perfect fetch, or the triumphant nap after a long play session—because those moments matter.</p>
